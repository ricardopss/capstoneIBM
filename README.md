# Advanced Data Science Capstone Project
----
This is the repository for the IBMs capstone project, a requirement for the _Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialization_.

As a capstone project I have built a system of sentiment classification trained on Twitter data. The main goal of this project is to computationally identify and categorize (`positive` or `negative`) the opinions expressed in a piece of text (tweet).

## Project structure:
The project was divided into 7 parts:

1. Use case
2. Data source
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): sentiments & tweets text
4. ETL overview
5. Sentiment Analysis Modelling: specification, training & evaluation
6. Deployment and benchmarking
7. Final Comments and Future Developments
