# Advanced Data Science Capstone Project
This is the repository for the IBMs capstone project, a requirement for the _Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialization_.

As a capstone project I have built a system of sentiment classification trained on Twitter data. The main goal of this project is to computationally identify and categorize (`positive` or `negative`) the opinions expressed in a piece of text (tweet).

## project structure:
The project was divided into 7 parts:

1. Use case
2. Data source
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): sentiments & tweets text
4. ETL overview
5. Sentiment Analysis Modelling: specification, training & evaluation
6. Deployment and benchmarking
7. Final Comments and Future Developments

## repository files:
- **mood_classifier.add.pdf:** documentation of the technology used in each stage of the project
- **mood_classifier.data_exp.ipynb:** contains the documentation of the exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **mood_classifier.etl.ipynb:** contains the documentation of the ETL executed
- **mood_classifier.models.v1.ipynb:** contains the results of the training and evaluation analysis for the baseline, challengers and final model
- **mood_classifier.models.v2.ipynb:** contains the results for the final model considering the full dataset.
- **pptx:** presentation made for stakeholders
